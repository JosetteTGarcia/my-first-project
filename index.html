            Hi, All! My name is Josette, or Jo, if you’d like. I’m located in Texas and I currently work as the Manager of Customer Support for a remote, SaaS company. I am currently on a career change journey to become a Software Engineer. I look forward to connecting with everyone at FlatIron and learning together. <br/>
